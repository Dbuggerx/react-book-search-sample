# This is still a work in progress

For now, I would ask to please consider the technical aspects involved, like:

* Server side rendering
* Code Splitting
* NodeJS / Express API
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) best practices
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (static and dynamic imported)
* [Redux-Observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) middleware, powered by RxJs (with dynamic imported epics)
* [Re-ducks](https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks) modular architecture
* CSS Grid
* Styles created using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) with the [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/);
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
* End-to-end tests using [TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/getting-started/) and [gherkin-testcafe](https://github.com/Dbuggerx/gherkin-testcafe)
