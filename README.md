For now, I would ask to please consider the technical aspects involved, like:

* Server side rendering
* Code Splitting
* NodeJS / Express API
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) best practices
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (static and dynamic imported)
* [Redux-Observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) middleware, powered by RxJs (with dynamic imported epics)
* [Re-ducks](https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks) modular architecture
* CSS Grid
* [Flow](https://flow.org/) type
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) styles
